git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: Synchronous user state initialization to prevent race condition

The subscription page redirect was caused by a race condition where the page
checked authentication before the async auth initialization completed.

FIX: Changed user state to use lazy initializer that reads from storage
synchronously during component mount. This ensures isAuthenticated is true
IMMEDIATELY if the user has logged in before.

Changes:
- Use useState lazy initializer for user state (reads from storage synchronously)
- Add comprehensive debug logging to subscriptions page
- Create standalone HTML test page at /auth-test.html
- Add 1-second defensive delay before redirect
- Enhanced error messages and diagnostics

This eliminates the race condition entirely and makes auth state instant."
